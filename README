A module providing a framework for configuration of components using 
arguments to a top-level function.

The module is released under MIT, the license is included in the source file.


Example:

>>> import keyconf
>>> component = keyconf.Configuration()

# Configure a key.
>>> component.configure(leaf = 'green')
>>> component['leaf']
'green'
>>> component
{'leaf': 'green'}


Now, let's use the {component} in another Configuration:

>>> top = keyconf.Configuration(sub = component)

# The component is hidden.
>>> top
{}

# Configure ordinary keys in {top}.
>>> top.configure(stem = 'brown')

# Configure {component} by calls to {top}.
>>> top.configure(sub_leaf = 'yellow')

# The key has been forwarded.
>>> component
{'leaf': 'yellow'}


Overwriting and deletion of keys:

# Configure the leaf again, but leave the value unchanged.
>>> component.configure(leaf = None)
>>> component['leaf']
'yellow'

# Delete an key, first create one, than delete it.
>>> component.configure(ill = 'faint green')
>>> top.unconfigure('sub_ill')
>>> component
{'leaf': 'yellow'}


Test whether some key is configured or not:

# Test for keys.
>>> top.is_configured('sub_ill')
False
>>> component.is_configured('leaf')
True


Components can be added later by:

>>> top.add_components(**components)

and can be deleted by:

>>> top.remove_components(*names)  .


Aliases make life easier or less troublesome sometimes:

>>> top.set_alises(alias = 'sub_leaf')
>>> top.is_configured('alias')
True
>>> top.unset_aliases('alias')
>>> top.is_configured('alias')
False
